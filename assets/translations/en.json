  "WhatIsTheFerberMethod": "What is the Ferber Method and its benefits?",
  "SecondNdFaq":"The Ferber method also known as \"graduated extinction\" was developed by pediatric sleep expert Dr. Richard Ferber.It teaches babies to self-soothe, so they can fall asleep on their own and fall back to sleep when they wake up during the night.",
  "SecondFurther":"Though emotionally challenging for parents, the process is very simple and brings with it a host of benefits for both the babies and parents.Once the baby has identified how to self-soothe and put themselves back to sleep - they sleep for longer, deeper, and are more rested when they wake up in the morning.For parents, they do not have to wake up multiple times in the middle of the night to rock or sing the baby back to sleep - 'self-soothing' teaches them how to go back to sleep on their own if they wake up in the middle of sleep.The Ferber method may be very hard for some parents, and strong resolve is needed to gain the benefits.Trust in yourself and trust in your instincts will go a long way. If you are successful with the method, both you and your baby will sleep better.",




  "ThirdFadLabel": "What are check-ins?",
  "TheProcess": "The process:",
  "Point1":"Start with the bedtime routine (see “before you start” section)",
  "Point2":"Once you feel the baby is drowsy but awake put the baby in bed (look for signs of yawning, rubbing eyes, drowsy eyes)",
  "Point3": "You may read the story at this point, if not already done so",
  "Point4":"Tell your baby goodnight. Tell them you love them and will see them in the morning and leave the room",
  "Point5":"If the baby cries, wait for the designated amount of time before you go back into the room",
  "Point6": "Comfort the baby by talking in a soothing voice, or gently patting them. Don't pick up the baby or feed them",
  "Point7": "Leave the room after a minute or so, or if the baby stops crying. Repeat as needed, ensuring that you have waited for the designated time",
  "ThirdFurther":"During the check-ins, you’ll go to your baby at timed intervals that gradually get longer until they fall asleep.The check-ins also get longer on subsequent nights. Dr. Ferber calls it the \"progressive waiting approach.\"",
  "FourthLabel":"Who is the Ferber method right for?",
  "FourthMain":"Babies are generally ready for sleep training, around 5 or 6 months. At that point, they’re developmentally capable of self-soothing.They’re also old enough to sleep through the night without eating. You don’t have to sleep train as soon as your baby hits the 5- or 6-month mark.If you feel more comfortable holding off until your little one is a bit older, that’s okay. Just keep in mind that the older your baby gets,the harder it might be for them to learn to fall asleep on their own.'",
  "FourthFurther":"Please make sure you have consulted with your baby's doctor before starting the Ferber method. This method should not be used with any babies with underlying health conditions or any types of sleep or other disorders. Always remember that you are the best judge of your baby's well-being.The Ferber method, the app, and the proposed times are only guides and you are in the driving seat.  Always pay attention to the baby's cries,if something does not feel right, act on your intuition, and the process can be continued later.",
  "FifthLabel":"What is self-soothing?'",
  "FifthMain":"Soothing is defined as babies getting a feeling of happiness and calm. This can be attained with a mother's touch, a father's voice, music from a toy,rocking, rubbing, or walking with baby in hand. Self-soothing is letting the baby identify ways where he/she could get the same feeling but on his / her own.This could be playing with their own fingers, scratching the bedsheet, muffling a blanket, or hugging a toy (remember Joey's hugsy?).",
  "FifthFurther":"Self-soothing is crucial not just to get to sleep, but also to stay asleep. We all sleep in cycles of 90 mins. Even as adults we wake up after each 90-minute cycle;either turning over or taking a deep sigh and eventually going back to sleep. However, babies are creatures of habit and haven’t learned to go back to sleep like this yet. Instead, if they are in the habit of being rocked to sleep; they want to be rocked back to sleep every 90-minutes.Hence,when managing to sleep on their own by self-soothing they can put themselves back to sleep again.",
  "SixthLabel":"Things to keep in mind before you start",
  "SixthMain":"Humans are creatures of habit. More so babies. Initiate a bedtime routine a few days before starting the Ferber method, so that the baby recognizes the cues to sleep.Whilst there’s no set rule, try to identify what works for your family. Some go for a bath time routine, while others go out for walks; however, reading a storybook remains the gold-standard (same one every night!) Self-soothing is the key to the Ferber method. Keep an assortment of props for the baby to choose from. For example, a soft blanket, a bedsheet, a toy that is travel-friendly.The most favored is a blanket, easy to carry and for night outs with family.",
  "SixthFurther":"Post the bedtime routine, make sure you start the training only when the baby is drowsy but awake. Make sure the baby is in a safe environment, and you can hear the baby crying from outside the room. If you have a baby monitor, make sure you are able to see the baby. But a baby monitor is not essential for the sleep training.Every baby is different and special in his/her own way. A majority take 3-7 days to learn to self-soothe while others take longer. The crying and time taken to sleep will reduce noticeably faster as the days pass. One thankful parent told us that their baby cried for a total of 16 mins on the first day, followed by 8 mins the next day, 6 mins the next day, and was asleep in 3 mins on the fourth day.",
